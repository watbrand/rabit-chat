You are the senior engineer + QA lead for RabitChat. Run a deep full-stack sweep to find and fix ALL loose ends / dead-ends across the entire app. Do NOT add new features or redesign; only fix broken behavior, missing wiring, cross-device issues, and incorrect logic. The result must be stable and fully operational.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1) Do not “assume” anything works. Verify with real execution paths.
2) Every UI action must call a real API route and persist in DB when applicable.
3) Fix root causes, not symptoms.
4) Ensure parity across Android + iOS + web (responsive + touch behavior).
5) Ensure admin panel functions match the same backend rules and are RBAC protected.
6) No placeholders, no TODOs, no alert() stubs, no silent failures.

PHASE 1 — AUTOMATED DISCOVERY (DEEP SEARCH)
A) Scan the codebase for:
- Buttons/links with no handler or broken route
- Components with disabled click via overlays/z-index on mobile
- API calls missing auth or wrong base URL
- Unhandled promise rejections and swallowed errors
- Endpoints referenced by UI that do not exist
- Endpoints that exist but do not validate or persist correctly
- Any mock/fake data paths still in use
- Any CORS/cookie/session settings that break on mobile browsers
- Upload limits/body size limits that break large media
- CSS blur/backdrop-filter overlays affecting readability (especially chat/messages)

B) Add minimal instrumentation to detect failures:
- Server logs for 401/403/422/500 with request path + error type
- Client error toasts for failed actions (no silent failures)
- A lightweight “smoke test” runner that calls key endpoints

PHASE 2 — END-TO-END FUNCTIONAL SWEEP (FIX EVERYTHING)
Fix all issues found in Phase 1, including but not limited to:
1) Mobile persistence failures (profile edits, cover/avatar updates, settings saves)
2) Mobile navigation/tap issues (icons not clickable due to layout overlays)
3) Posting flow failures on Android for all post types (text/photo/video/voice)
4) Comments + saves/bookmarks fully working end-to-end
5) Video playback reliability (correct URL access, MIME type, CORS/range, player setup)
6) Upload limit increase for video to 500MB (wherever enforced: API + server + provider)
7) Notifications:
   - consistent layout (not hidden under header)
   - backend creation on like/comment/follow/message
   - deep-link routing to the exact target (post/comment/profile/conversation)
8) Follow-back logic:
   - if someone follows viewer and viewer does not follow them -> show “Follow Back”
9) Chat readability:
   - remove/contain blur effects so messages never become blurry on iOS or Android
10) Admin panel:
   - verify every admin action works from mobile and web
   - RBAC checks correct
   - audit logs written for all sensitive actions

PHASE 3 — POLICY + DATA INTEGRITY ENFORCEMENT
Ensure centralized policy checks are used everywhere (profile privacy, post visibility, blocks, comment/message permissions). Fix any endpoint that bypasses policy rules. Ensure transactions update counters safely and constraints are correct.

PHASE 4 — PROOF + DOCUMENTATION
Create these files and keep them accurate:
1) /docs/DEEP_SWEEP_REPORT.md
   - list every bug found, root cause, fix, and file paths changed
2) /docs/SMOKE_TESTS.md
   - what smoke tests exist and how to run them
3) /docs/DEVICE_TEST_PLAN.md
   - Android checklist, iOS checklist, Admin checklist with pass criteria

Add a “done gate”:
- Do not conclude until ALL smoke tests pass and all checklists can be completed without errors.
- Confirm explicitly that: profile updates, settings, posting, comments, saves, video playback, messages readability, notifications deep-linking, follow-back, and admin actions all work across Android+iOS+web.

FINAL OUTPUT
After implementing fixes, print a short summary:
- total issues found
- total issues fixed
- remaining known limitations (should be none for core flows)
- exact steps to verify on Android/iOS/Admin
